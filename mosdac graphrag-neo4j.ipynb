This was the first satellite launched by the PSLV into the Geo-stationary orbit. The satellite was originally known as MetSat-1. On February 5, 2003 it was renamed to Kalpana-1 by the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of Kalpana Chawla?a NASA astronaut who perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.\\n\\nThe satellite features a Very High Resolution scanning Radiometer (VHRR), for three-band images and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) payload.\\n\\nSo far, meteorological services had been combined with telecommunication and television services in the INSAT series. MetSat-1 is a precursor to the future INSAT system that will have separate satellites for meteorology and telecommunication & broadcasting services.\\n\\nSearch\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\nFacebook icon\\n\\nYoutube (Channel) icon\\n\\nRSS icon\\n\\nWebsite owned and maintained by MOSDAC, Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Govt. of INDIA.\\n\\nCQW LOGO\\n\\nISRO\\n\\nSpace Applications Center\\n\\nNationalPortal\\n\\nMyGov\\n\\nDigitalIndia\\n\\nDataPortal\\n\\n\"Ver 3.0; Last reviewed and updated on 15 Oct, 2025& Served By: Web-Srv-Pri', 'source': 'https://www.mosdac.gov.in/kalpana-1-introduction'}}\n"

KALPANA-1 » Introduction\\n\\nKALPANA-1 Introduction\\n\\nKalpana-1 is the first dedicated meteorological satellite launched by Indian Space Research Organisation using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on 2002-09-12. This was the first satellite launched by the PSLV into the Geo-stationary orbit. The satellite was originally known as MetSat-1. On February 5, 2003 it was renamed to Kalpana-1 by the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of Kalpana Chawla?a NASA astronaut who perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.\\n\\nThe satellite features a Very High Resolution scanning Radiometer (VHRR), for three-band images and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) payload.\\n\\nSo far, meteorological services had been combined with telecommunication and television services in the INSAT series. MetSat-1 is a precursor to the future INSAT system that will have separate satellites for meteorology and telecommunication & broadcasting services.\\n\\nSearch\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\nFacebook icon\\n\\nYoutube (Channel) icon\\n\\nRSS icon\\n\\nWebsite owned and maintained by MOSDAC, Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Govt. of INDIA.\\n\\nCQW LOGO\\n\\nISRO\\n\\nSpace Applications Center\\n\\nNationalPortal\\n\\nMyGov\\n\\nDigitalIndia\\n\\nDataPortal\\n\\n\"Ver 3.0; Last reviewed and updated on 05 Nov, 2025& Served By: Web-Srv-Pri'))]"
